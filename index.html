            <h1>Robert James Fischer</h1>
            <p>(March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008)
                was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he won
                his
                first of a record eight US Championships at the age of 14. In 1964, he won with an 11–0 score,
                the
                only
                perfect score in the history of the tournament.
                Bobby became the Chess Grandmaster at the age of 15 years. He set the record of becoming the
                youngest
                grandmaster at that time. Bobby was quite famous now for scoring all three GM norms at such a young
                age. His main focus was to fight hard and win the game. Fischer was said to be the deep positional
                player. Sometimes he can be aggressive too. He mostly liked to start with 1.e4. He always
                played
                for the
                win, he has converted many drawn games to winning games.
                After not defending his title in 1975, Fischer didn’t play any public or competitive chess for about 20
                years. He was completely underground, living in San Francisco and Pasadena. He became a member of a
                cult. Somehow, Fischer was ready to play in 1992, this tournament was against the US chess federation
                and Fischer was warned too. This event was held in Yugoslavia. Without taking the warning seriously, he
                played the tournament and won it.

        <p>On September 1, 1972, in what’s billed as the “Match of the Century,” American chess grandmaster Bobby
            Fischer defeats Russian Boris Spassky during the World Chess Championship in Reykjavik, Iceland.
            In the world’s most publicized title match ever played, Fischer, a 29-year-old Brooklynite, became the first
            American to win the competition since its inception in 1866. The victory also marked the first time a
            non-Russian had won the event in 24 years.</p>

        <p>In 1996, Fischer presented to the public the random chess he developed
            (Fischerandom chess). In this chess, all the rules of the game are preserved, except for the initial
            arrangement
            of pieces, which is chosen randomly from 960 options (the order of castling has been changed). The
            invariance of
            the initial positions in this game nullifies the experience of chess openings and "home preparations". This
            forces the players from the first moves not to play according to a learned pattern, but to seriously analyze
            the
            position.</p>
